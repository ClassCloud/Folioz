Feature: Sending friend requests
In order to send a friend request and be directed to the right page
As an admin/user
So I can be friends with other users

     | username | password | email | firstname | lastname | institution | authname | role |

Given I log in as "admin" with password "Kupuhipa1"
And I choose "User search" in "Users" from administration menu
And I follow "Pete"

And I press "Request friendship"
And I follow "Become Admin User again"
And I am on homepage
# In my inbox block I'll see "New friend request"

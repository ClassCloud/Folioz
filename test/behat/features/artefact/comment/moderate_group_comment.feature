    # Adding a comment to a group page as a non-group member
    Given I log in as "userC" with password "Kupuhipa1"
    And I go to portfolio page "Page1"
    And I set the field "Comment" to "This is a comment from userC"
    And I enable the switch "Make comment public"
    And I press "Comment"
    Then I should see "You have requested that this comment be made public." in the ".feedbacktable" "css_element"
    And I log out

    # Checking that normal group member is not able to moderate comment
    Given I log in as "userB" with password "Kupuhipa1"
    And I go to portfolio page "Page1"
    Then I should not see "This is a comment from userC"
    And I log out

    And I go to portfolio page "Page1"
    Then I should see "This is a comment from userC"
    And I press "Make comment public"

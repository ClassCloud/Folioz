Feature: Allow user csv upload to ignore non-essential mandatory fields
    In order to add users by csv
    As an admin follow through add users by csv
    So I can change the mandatory fields

Scenario: Create users by csv (Bug 1426983)
    # Log in as "Admin" user
    Given I log in as "admin" with password "Kupuhipa1"
    # Verifying log in was successful
    And I should see "Admin User"
    # Adding Users by CVS
    And I choose "Add users by CSV" in "Users" from administration menu
    And I attach the file "UserCSV.csv" to "CSV file"
    And I disable the switch "Force password change"
    And I disable the switch "Email users about their account"
    And I press "Add users by CSV"
    Then I should see "Your CSV file was processed successfully"
    And I should see "New users added: 4."

    # Check that we can delete a user after upload (Bug #1558864)
    And I choose "User search" in "Users" from administration menu
    And I follow "kevin01"
    And I follow "Suspend or delete this user"
    And I scroll to the id "delete"
    And I press and confirm "Delete user"
    And I should see "User deleted successfully"
